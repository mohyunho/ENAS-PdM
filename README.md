# ENAS-PdM
![GitHub Logo](/cnnlstm.png)
ENAS-PdM is a custom Evolutionary Algorithm specifically designed to optimize a Deep Network architecture used to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for predictive maintenance (PdM). Based on our previous work [Multi-Head CNN-LSTM with Prediction Error Analysis for Remaining Useful Life Prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9211058), the goal of this study is to find the best multi-head Convolutional Neural Network with Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) architecture for the RUL prediction. For that, we use evolutionary search to explore the combinatorial parameter space of a multi-head CNN-LSTM as shown below figure.
